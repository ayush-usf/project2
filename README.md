# Project 2: Shape Sorter

Due: September 23

For this project, you will design and implement:
- a hierarchy of classes representing several 2D and 3D shapes, 
- classes that implement Comparator interface and compare shapes based on name, area, perimeter or volume, 
- ShaperSorter class that stores and sorts shapes, and outputs the results to the file. 

You will also write several JUnit tests to test methods in these classes. You will practice:
- Using abstract classes, inheritance and polymorphism
- Implementing Comparator interface
- File input/output
- Writing JUnit tests
- Using Java generics (for 1-2 methods only)

For full description of the project, please see the pdf posted on Canvas.
